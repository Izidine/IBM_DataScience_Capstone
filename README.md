## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background

Due to the outbreak of Coronavirus in the world and the growing cases presented by World Health Organization (WHO), the United States has become the epicenter of this epidemic, with New York (NY) State being the state with the most confirmed positive cases. In order to help reduce the number of positive cases and the rapid spread of the virus (COVID-19), WHO has appointed specialist doctors from different countries to the United States, with the New York as its initial destination. However, the WHO delegation needs to find a strategic hotel to stay at.

### 1.2. Business Problem

The quick way of COVID-19 contagion has proved to be a major challenge for front line professionals, so the WHO delegation intends to take all precautions, staying in a Hotel located in the County with major positive cases of COVID-19 in NY State (to address the pandemic), but closest (less than 1.5 KM) to hospitals for first aid purposes.

### 1.3. Data Sources

In order to achieve the goal of this project, in this project we will be using the following data sources:
##### I. Geodata of Hotels and Hospitals in New York using Foursquare API
We will get all the hotels and hospitals located on the county with major confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NY State, using Foursquare API.
##### II. Dataset of New York State Statewide COVID-19 Testing
This dataset includes information on the number of tests of individuals for
COVID-19 infection performed in New York State beginning March 1, 2020,
when the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the state. The primary goal
of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local
disease spread and reporting of positive cases.
The Dataset can be found on: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e
